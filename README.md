‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

Removed from public feature list: I did not list gameplay exploit modes like advanced aimbot, noclip, or any other offensive PvP cheats in this announcement because your changelogs above do not add them. Keep the public docs aligned with actual implemented features.

Anti-Die: only functions where the game exposes a backdoor/hook that Lunar can use ‚Äî not guaranteed across all titles.
